* Chapter 1. The activity and art of reading

Readers are people accustomed to gain a large share of their information about and thir understanding of the world from the written world.

It may be seriously questioned whethet the advent of modern communications media (此处指radio and television, 对应21世纪的是internet) has 
much enhanced our understanding of the world in which we live.

We do not have to know everything about something in order to understand it. Too many facts are often as much of an obstacle to understanding
as too few.

The very media (Radio and TV) are so designed as to make thinking seem unnecessary.

**The purpose is to call attention to the fact that reading can be more or less active, and the point out that the more active the reading better.
