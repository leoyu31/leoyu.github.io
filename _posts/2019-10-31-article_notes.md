**Title**:

**Key words**: photosynthetic acclimation, acclimation, sun-shade responses, plasticity, tropical seedlings

**Content**:

* Evaluate p-s plasticity and acclimation of seedlings of 5 tropical trees with
defferent habitat breadth and successional status.

* Early successional species show high p-s plasticity and high Pn after trasfered to hight light.

* Late successionak species show low plasticity and acclimation potential. No or Marginal increase
of Pn after trasfer.

* Suggestion: Acclimation potential cannot always be infered from plasticity.

* Strong relationship between Pn max and nitrogen content.

**Title**:

**Key words**: light acclimation, phenotypic plasticity, tropical forest

**Content**:

* Phenotypic plasticity of 16 tropical forest shrubs (6 in gap, and 10 in understorey) investigated, grew in three light regimes, namely low light, intermidiate, and high light. 

* Shoot RGR similiar for all species in low light. Shoot RGR sig. higher in intermidiate light than in high light, for gap species.

* Plasticity of morphological traits sig. lower than physiological traits.

* Plasticity of gap species sig. higher than understorey species.

* Phenotypic plasticity decreased with increase in leaf longevity.

* Suggestion: High plasticity for gap species is adaptive in gap habitat.
