**Title**:

**Key words**: photosynthetic acclimation, acclimation, sun-shade responses, plasticity, tropical seedlings

**Content**:

* Evaluate p-s plasticity and acclimation of seedlings of 5 tropical trees with
defferent habitat breadth and successional status.

* Early successional species show high p-s plasticity and high Pn after trasfered to hight light.

* Late successionak species show low plasticity and acclimation potential. No or Marginal increase
of Pn after trasfer.

* Suggestion: Acclimation potential cannot always be infered from plasticity.

* Strong relationship between Pn max and nitrogen content.
