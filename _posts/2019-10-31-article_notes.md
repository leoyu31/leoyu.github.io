**Title**: Plasticity and acclimation to light in tropical Moraceae of different sucessional positions

**Key words**: photosynthetic acclimation, acclimation, sun-shade responses, plasticity, tropical seedlings

**Content**:

* Evaluate p-s plasticity and acclimation of seedlings of 5 tropical trees with
defferent habitat breadth and successional status.

* Early successional species show high p-s plasticity and high Pn after trasfered to hight light.

* Late successionak species show low plasticity and acclimation potential. No or Marginal increase
of Pn after trasfer.

* Suggestion: Acclimation potential cannot always be infered from plasticity.

* Strong relationship between Pn max and nitrogen content.

**Title**: Plastic phenotypic response to light of 16 congeneric shrubs from a Panamanian rainforest

**Key words**: light acclimation, phenotypic plasticity, tropical forest

**Content**:

* Phenotypic plasticity of 16 tropical forest shrubs (6 in gap, and 10 in understorey) investigated, grew in three light regimes, namely low light, intermidiate, and high light. 

* Shoot RGR similiar for all species in low light. Shoot RGR sig. higher in intermidiate light than in high light, for gap species.

* Plasticity of morphological traits sig. lower than physiological traits.

* Plasticity of gap species sig. higher than understorey species.

* Phenotypic plasticity decreased with increase in leaf longevity.

* Suggestion: High plasticity for gap species is adaptive in gap habitat.

**Title**: Photosynthetic acclimation of plants to growth irradiance: the relative importance of specific leaf area and nitrogen partitioning in maximizing carbon gain

**key words**: p-s, light absorptance, Rubisco, sun-shade acclimation, SLA, nitrogen partition

**Content**:

* Quantified the relationship between changes in SLA and nitrogen partition, and changes in carbon gain, of 10 C3 species.

* Pn per area under high light 3 times than under low light, 2 times for saturated Pn.

* Pn per dry mass constant (2 times SLA under low light)

* Nitrogen per dry mass constant, but more distrubution in light harvesting under low light.

* Pn per dry mass under low light much more responsive to SLA than nitrogen, and SLA still more important 
than nitrogen under high light.
